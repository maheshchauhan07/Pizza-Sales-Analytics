# ⚙️ Pipeline Flow

## Step 1 — Data Ingestion

Raw pizza sales data is ingested from **CSV files** into the **Snowflake staging layer**.

## Step 2 — Pipeline Orchestration

**Apache Airflow DAGs** automate the data pipeline including ingestion, transformations, and validations.

## Step 3 — Data Transformation

**SQL transformations** convert raw staging data into structured warehouse tables.

## Step 4 — Data Warehouse

A **Star Schema data mart** is created containing fact and dimension tables.

## Step 5 — Exploratory Data Analysis

SQL queries are used to analyze patterns, validate metrics, and explore business trends.

## Step 6 — Business Intelligence

**Power BI dashboards** visualize key metrics and insights.
